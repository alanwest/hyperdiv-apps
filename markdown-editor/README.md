# Markdown Editor

This is a basic markdown editor/previewer written in Hyperdiv. Note that this editor can't load files, like images, from arbitrary paths on the file system. It can refer to images stored in an `assets` directory created in the same directory as `start.py`.

Usage:

```sh
python start.py <path_to_markdown_file>
```
